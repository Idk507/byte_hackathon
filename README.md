-	Revolutionizing Student Progress Tracking: Innovations for Real-Time Monitoring and Holistic Feedback


Why choose this problem statement ?
-	It is quite difficult to manually maintain the results and performance of pupils, which may lead to inaccuracies. Manual detection of student performance tracking is difficult since performance tracking involves not only grades but also attendance, which is difficult to manage due to the large number of students data. We leverage technology aspects of solutions to assist management in dealing with such challenges as record management.


How are you planning on solving this problem ? 
PROBLEM SOLVING & METHODOLOGY:

The objective of this project is to develop Student Grading System, application implemented using Python3 and MySQLdb.
This system will provides Command Line interface for instructors to set up coursework including grade results and attendance tracking

METHODOLOGY:
Those are the functional requirements for the system described the services .

1-Instructors operations:
•	Adding instructors
•	Update instructors
•	Display all instructors
2-Students operations:
•	Adding Students
•	Update students
•	Display all students
3- Subjects operations:
•	Adding Subjects
•	Update subjects
•	Delete subjects
•	Display all subjects
4-Sections operations:
•	Adding sections
•	Delete sections
•	Display all sections
5-Attendance operations:
•	Adding attendance files
•	Update attendance files
•	Delete attendance files
•	Display all attendance files
6-Marks operations:	
•	Adding Exams marks(First, Second, Final)
•	Adding participation mark(depending on absents\exclude absents)
•	Update marks
•	Display marks(one student\all students)
7-Make your own MySQL operation:
•	This function can make you write your own MySQL statement
8-Backup your database
9-Import your backup

CONCLUSION:
 To be conclude that the model would help the management in many useful apects ,so that teachers can take the "Student Tracking System" with them wherever they go.The "Student Tracking System" can calculate your grades and track your attendance. All the instructor has to do is enter the student grades, and it will automatically add and average them.If a teacher believes that additional features should be added to the system, he or she can readily modify the system to meet those demands. Finally, we are employing the Open Source philosophy, and the source code will be made available on the system's official website.
